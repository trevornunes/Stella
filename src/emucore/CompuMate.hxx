/**
  The Spectravideo CompuMate SV010 was a home computer expansion for the
  Atari VCS / 2600 video game system.

  It consists of a membrane keyboard unit with interface connectors. These
  connectors were placed in the module slot and both controller ports of the
  Atari console.  As the user could place the keyboard on the old style VCS
  consoles, the two devices resulted in one compact unit. When using with the
  2600jr console, resulted in a desktop computer look with separated keyboard.

  The CompuMate was equipped with an audio jack for use with a standard tape
  connector as a possibility of permanent data storage.

  Bankswitching is done though the controller ports
    INPT0: D7 = CTRL key input (0 on startup / 1 = key pressed)
    INPT1: D7 = always HIGH input (tested at startup)
    INPT2: D7 = always HIGH input (tested at startup)
    INPT3: D7 = SHIFT key input (0 on startup / 1 = key pressed)
    INPT4: D7 = keyboard row 1 input (0 = key pressed)
    INPT5: D7 = keyboard row 3 input (0 = key pressed)
    SWCHA: D7 = tape recorder I/O ?
           D6 = 1 -> increase key collumn (0 to 9)
           D5 = 1 -> reset key collumn to 0 (if D4 = 0)
           D5 = 0 -> enable RAM writing (if D4 = 1)
           D4 = 1 -> map 2K of RAM at $1800 - $1fff
           D3 = keyboard row 4 input (0 = key pressed)
           D2 = keyboard row 2 input (0 = key pressed)
           D1 = bank select high bit
           D0 = bank select low bit

  Keyboard column numbering:
    column 0 = 7 U J M
    column 1 = 6 Y H N
    column 2 = 8 I K ,
    column 3 = 2 W S X
    column 4 = 3 E D C
    column 5 = 0 P ENTER SPACE
    column 6 = 9 O L .
    column 7 = 5 T G B
    column 8 = 1 Q A Z
    column 9 = 4 R F V

  This code was heavily borrowed from z26, and uses conventions defined
  there.  Specifically, IOPortA is treated as a complete uInt8, whereas
  the Stella core actually stores this information in boolean arrays
  addressable by DigitalPin number.
