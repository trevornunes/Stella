/**
  This class is a wrapper around the Distella code.  Much of the code remains
  exactly the same, except that generated data is now redirected to a
  DisassemblyList structure rather than being printed.

  All 7800-related stuff has been removed, as well as all commandline options.
  For now, the only configurable item is whether to automatically determine
  code vs. data sections (which is on by default).  Over time, some of the
  configurability of Distella may be added again.
